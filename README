"kon" is derived from "конь", the Russian word for Knight, and denotes a simple
command-line tool for generating Fischer Random Chess (also called Chess960)
starting positions, either randomly or by #id.

Of course, you can find dozens of tools like that out there, especially online
applets (see links below), but I thought it would be fun to implement that as a
mini-project, trying to get my hands a bit dirty with python.  Another aspect
that comes to my mind right now: there are only 960 positions in that game,
which means we could easily just save all those positions once in a file and
the "generator" does nothing more than randomly create a number between 0 and
959 and get the approprite entry from the file that number references to. *But*
nevertheless just for fun, I want those positions to be calculated every time
(it's a trivial procedure anyway), maybe I have to implement it on a very
memory-limited microcontroller some day, who knows? ;-)
